--- Synopsis ---

Single page website to promote a local Surfing event sponsored by Barrett Homes.

The primary purpose of the website is to promote the event and congratulate participants from previous years (this will also increase the profile of the event in the local community and generate interest for the 2018 event).  

Additionally, users can register their interest to enter the 2018 competition and by doing so they enter the draw to win a custom surfboard.  

Note: This competition is not active, has not been approved by the client, and in draft format for testing/review purposes only.

--- Integration ---

Competitor images are pulled in via the 'flickr' API in JSON-P format.  

--- Planned in next release ---

- Styling across the website, in particular intro section, Hall Of Fame & Form
- Additional image assets including graphic of surfboard to win
- Mobile responsive updates
- Sponsor logo footer to be populated.
